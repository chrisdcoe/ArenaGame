# ArenaGame
Made for a class project. Though I was originally intending to make a simple game, getting the hang of MVC
coding took a bit more work than I expected. That's fine though!

So I focused my effort on coding up a database manipulation tool that can be used to read from the database,
create new entries, edit them, and delete them. I showcased how this could apply to a database of weapons
that the player might purchase from shops and then equip. Future versions will also have armor, potions,
and enemies.
